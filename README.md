PROBLEM:
Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material 
that is useless during a manufacturing process.

We are looking for a software solution which would help in development of business models 
for collection and utilization of single use plastics and various other industrial wastes by using items like: a. Ceramics b. Bamboo c. Wood d. Jute e. Cloth g. Tetra packs, etc.

generate some revenue stream/business model and cause less harm to environment.
